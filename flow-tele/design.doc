Notes for NFP-SDK interface:

-   Can we rewrite tah_sdk_<plat>_netflow_sensor.c to using a more consolidated interface? Should they be moved under HAL?
-   index to read_tah_sdk_hea_ftb_fttile() seems to be per entry (i.e. 0-64k)
-   Is ipv4/ipv6 records always stored in FULL mode?
-   whatis ftcam_data.analytics_valid bit in netflow_sensor_ftcam_entry

UT Coverage:
- reload
- process restart
- switch-over (ISSU)
- config/no config
    - config replace
    - checkpoints
    - ascii

Coding Guidelines:
- consistent debug and trace logs (no separate buginf_wrap etc..)
    - fix broad categories for debug/traces (DB_NF_ERROR, DBG_RTP_ etc...)
    - check binary logging
    - separate based on high/low freq trace generation?


ASIC Details
    4k Rows * 4 Banks per slice
    Each bank can store 4 condensed ipv4, or 2 full ipv4, or 1 ipv6.
    (Max capacity = 4k * 4 * 4 = 64K condensed ipv4)
    Reads/Write entire 4 banks at a time. i.e. each row corresponds to one hash-value
    Update Cycle, has a pipline of 20 cyles (i.e. 20 hash values)
    Exporter Cycle, blocks if the row its processing is in the Update cycle's pipeline.
    Update Cycle:
        - compute update-hash (12 bits = 4K) for incomming flow. (range: 0-4k)
        - read row for all 4 banks at once
            - search row for flow. also search overflow tcam for flow.
                - if found, update entry
                - if not found, increment "create" counter. try to insert. 
                    - if both row and overflow tcam are full, drop
                    - if row is full and overflow tcam has space, insert in overflow-tcam. 
                        - increment "insert" counter. 
                        - set valid bit.
                    - if row has space, insert and increment "insert" couter
                        - increment "insert" counter. 
                        - set valid bit.
        |_ go to next row

    Export Cycle:
        - for each collector:
            - for each row.
                - if row index is in Update Cycle Pipeline. Block
                - if row index ins not in Update Cycle Pipeline, read all entries and compute their export-hash (16 bits = 64K?) value.
                    - if export-hash values matches that of collector
                        - send entry to FTPacket FIFO.
                        - reset valid bit in bank.
            |_ go to next row
        |_ go to next collector

questions:
    interlace wr/read
    index overflow? A: not indexed
    how long has there been and entry in a row
    wait for read-lock? how long?
